## Overview
Coming across a seemingly good business idea while vacationing on Oahu, Hawaii: a Surf n' Shake Shop, however, investor backing is needed so W. Avy, a hawaiian investor, seems interested in the idea but in order to give a definite answer he needs data retrieval concerning weather issues.

  - hawaii.sqlite
 
- Software:
  - SQLite
