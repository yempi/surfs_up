### Advanced Data Storage & Retrieval

## Overview
Coming across a seemingly good business idea while vacationing on Oahu, Hawaii: a Surf n' Shake Shop, however, investor backing is needed so W. Avy, a hawaiian investor, seems interested in the idea but in order to give a definite answer he needs data retrieval concerning weather issues.

In order to compare this weather concerns June and December's temperatures were compared for their opposite qualities such as summer/winter to determine if there is an extreme change or nothing to worry about.

## Resources
- Data: 
  - hawaii.sqlite
 
- Software:
  - SQLite
  - Python 3.9.7
  - Flask
  - Jupyter Notebook   

## Results
After getting the statistics for each month the results look like this:

Figure 2. Statistics for precipitation in June and December.

- The average temperature for both months are in the 70-75 °F range, concluding that there is a minimal difference between June (74.94 °F) and December's  (71.04 °F) temperatures.

- The difference between min and max temperatures for June is 21 °F and for December 27 °F. This means that the value of temp fluctuates more in December but comparing it with June the only difference are 6 °F so it can be ignored and concluded that the fluctuations are almost the same.

- As opposed to the temperature values, average precipitation values are higher in December (0.21 in) instead of June (0.13 in) as seen in Fig. 1 with a difference of 8 in.

## Summary
Coming back to the purpose of this analysis, the data shows that there is not much difference between peak points of summer and winter that, as we know, are polar opposites in most of the world in weather concerns. The main concern being rain is thrown out of the window with this results as it can be seen that rainfall is low throughout the year and, additionally, the temperature remains in a 5 °F interval so a conclusion that it is steady can be done.

To add on this findings, and to have a complete picture of Hawaii's weather, an all-year-round analysis of temperature and precipitation can be done, as well as fluctuation of tourists of the zone that the shop will be set in.
